*Federalist 10 & 51 have to do with factions.  How despite what Montesquieu argued in his "The Spirit of the Laws", republican government CAN work for a large hetereogeneous population, since the bigger the nation, the more room for factions whose interests can offset each other.  
*Federalist 39:  jurisdiction of the national government extends to certain enumerated objects only and leave to the several states a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other object 
* Federalist 45:  The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are 
few and defined.
